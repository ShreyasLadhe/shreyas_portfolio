You cannot have a broad rule and a specific, referenced rule for the same port simultaneously in this manner. The fix required a disciplined sequence: first, **delete the insecure 0.0.0.0/0 rule**, save the changes (briefly leaving the instance with no SSH access path), and then add the new, secure rule referencing `bastion-sg`. This reinforces that secure network changes must be deliberate and sequential.",

          "**The Lesson:** The devil is in the details. The installation script for Node Version Manager (NVM) adds its path to the user's environment, but not necessarily to the root user's environment that `sudo` uses. The fix was to use the full, exact path returned by the `which node` command (`/home/ec2-user/.nvm/versions/node/v18.20.8/bin/node`). It's a classic reminder to always substitute placeholders with actual values from your specific environment.",
          "**The 503 Error and the Silent Health Check**",
          "**The Issue:** The Application Load Balancer (ALB) was `active`, the EC2 instance was running, and the app was started. Yet, accessing the ALB's DNS name resulted in a 503 Service Unavailable error. The app was working, but the outside world couldn't reach it.",
          "**The Lesson:** The culprit was the ALB's health checks. The ALB continuously pings the application to ensure it's healthy before sending traffic. This health check traffic was being blocked by the EC2 instance's own security group. The fix was to go back to the `app-sg` security group and add an inbound rule allowing HTTP traffic on port 80, with the source set to the ALB's security group (`alb-sg`). This ensures that only the load balancer can communicate with the application, a core tenet of this secure design.",
          "**The Private Key Permission Puzzle**",
          "**The Issue:** To connect from the Bastion Host to the private EC2 instance, the `.pem` private key file is needed. After successfully copying the key to the Bastion, attempting to use it for SSH resulted in a **permissions too open** error.",
          "**The Lesson:** This is not a bug, but a critical security feature of SSH. A private key must be private. If its file permissions allow other users on the system to read it, SSH assumes it may have been compromised and refuses to use it. The solution is to strictly lock down the file's permissions with the command `chmod 400 ssh-key.pem` on the Bastion Host, which grants read access only to the file's owner.",

          "The current design places the application server in a single Availability Zone (AZ). To protect against an AZ failure, the next step is to use an **EC2 Auto Scaling group**. By configuring a launch template and spanning the Auto Scaling group across the private subnets in both Availability Zones, the system can automatically handle instance failure and scale in or out based on traffic, ensuring high availability and elasticity.",
